# Code Sample for Internship Applicants

This small project will produce a Vue.js-powered résumé.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your computer, and remove the `.git` directory. Then create a new private repository at GitHub, and re-initialize your local repository to reference your new private repository. (Invite me to collaborate on your private repository!)
2. Open `index.html` directly in your browser.
3. Edit the repository files to build a résumé modeled on the design file (will be emailed to you).
4. Tackle the work in small tasks, making frequent commits to describe your progress.
5. Once finished, share your private repository with us.


## Instructions

1. Use the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) to retrieve the JSON data from https://wip.journeygroup.com/intern-api/joshbryant.json.
2. In `app/main.js`, create Vue components to render the data into semantic HTML.
3. In `css/main.css`, add styles to mimic the layout modeled in the design.
4. In `css/main.css`, add styles to mimic the type styles modeled in the design.

**Bonus:** Add any accessibility or interactive enhancements you think would improve the experience and exhibit your strengths.
